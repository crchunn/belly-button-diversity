# belly-button-diversity
Amazing things live on our bodies, including in our belly buttons! This project is to show the different types of organisms that live in the belly buttons of a sample of the population. We take the json file, and filter it, to show what kinds of organisms, and how many lived in their belly buttons. 
We used json, javascript and html to parse through the data and give a visual to the information. Plotly is a fascinating program that gives the graphs more options.
